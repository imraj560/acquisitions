🚀 Acquisitions API

A production-ready Node.js + Express REST API built with modern DevOps, security, and testing best practices. This project demonstrates real-world skills in backend engineering with CI/CD pipeline automation using githu workflow, containerization and securing the API endpoints.

✨ Features

🔐 API Security — Protected using Arcjet (rate limiting, bot protection, abuse prevention).

🧪 Automated Testing — I implemented the testig of the API endpoints using Jest Library

🔁 CI/CD Pipeline — Fully automated build, test, and Docker image publishing using GitHub Actions and workflows

🐳 Dockerized — Production-ready Docker image tested locally and in production

⚡ Modern Stack — Kept it simple and light used Node + Express for the API
